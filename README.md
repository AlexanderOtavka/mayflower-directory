Below are some notes from JHB & KY:

**What we accomplished**
    1. Set up an admin model by adding a boolean field to the User controller
    2. We utilized the Devise gem to handle all issues relating to user access to the page
    3. Made a nav bar 
    4. Gave the admin the ability to add, edit and delete resident entries in the db
    5. Going off that, we set up the backend database
    
    
**What we learned**
    1. Read documentation all the way through before implementing gems - (Don't use a gem you don't understand)
    2. Hartl is way more helpful than you think.
    3. If you think youre going to mess it up make branch! Use different workspaces!
    4. Asking questions is much more efficient than googling the answer - (also sometimes all you need to do is restart)
    5. Be POLITE to the clients and make sure to ask questions and TALK to them.
    6. NEVER use git add .
    
    
**To do**
    1. We recommend adding a checkbox when the admin make a new user to designate that user as another admin
    2. Find a way for admin to delete users
    3. Do a usability analysis // make it pretty. 
        - The font is too small in some places
        - add a drop down menu for neighborhoods instead of having them enter it as a string field
        - don't display results at the bottom of the search page
